*may they spare your soul*

## Demo Instructions
👏 install the packages 👏  build/deploy the contracts (locally) 👏 build/host the FE 👇 
```
COH/$ yarn install
COH/packages/contracts/$ yarn dev
COH/packages/client/$ yarn start
```

now wait (~50 blocks), you'll see..
- [MUD](https://mud.dev/) `Components` and `Systems` automagically deployed
- a browser tab spawn with the newly generated url parameter
- a loading screen and placeholder image prior to the world being intialized/indexed

from this window you should..
- open the dev console (`Option + ⌘ + J` on macOS OR `Shift + CTRL + J` on Windows/Linux) on a chromium based browser
- run `layers.network.api.admin.init()` in the console (the deployer address should already by connected for admin api access)
- enter name and explore :yayayayayayay:
